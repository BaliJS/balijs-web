## BaliJS Website.

This site is a fork of [SydJS](https://github.com/JedWatson/sydjs-site) website created using [KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com) from [Thinkmill](http://www.thinkmill.com.au).
After a couple of research, we decide that we are going to use [KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com) for the Bali Javascript community site.

## Get Involved!

Please use the GitHub Issues to log any ideas you have to improve the site, or problems you may come across.

Feel free to ask questions about how it works, if you're getting into the code.

If you are part of another meetup group and want to use our site as a basis for your own, that's great, we'd love to hear about it.
